# How to Deploy a Keras Model to Production

## Dependencies

```pip install -r requirements.txt -i "https://pypi.douban.com/simple"```

## Usage

Once dependencies are installed, just run this to see it in your browser. 

```python app.py```

That's it! It's serving a saved Keras model to you via Flask. 

Or deploy by gunicorn.

```sh start.sh```
